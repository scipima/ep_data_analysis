Where the Member States do not make use of this possibility, farmers, producer organisations or associations of producer organisations can request the use of written contracts. However, due to the weaker bargaining position of farmers and the fear of commercial retaliation by purchasers, it can be difficult for farmers and their associations to make such a request. To increase trust, transparency, and efficiency within the supply chain and to enable all farmers, producer organisations and associations of producer organisations to benefit from the use of written contracts, deliveries of agricultural products in the Union by a farmer, a producer organisation or an association of producer organisations to a processor, distributor or retailer should be covered by a written contract.
